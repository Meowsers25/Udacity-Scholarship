Your response goes here!

I've learned some new html tags that I wasn't familiar with.

I have some experience with html, so knowing where to use the more popular tags was easy for me.

So far, learning the workflow with the course has been a bit difficult. I had trouble opening
the projects in my browser. The support in the forums was extremely helpful.

The biggest strategy that I use is MDN. When I have a question about my code, MDN is usually
my first stop!
